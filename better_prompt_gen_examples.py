    prompt = f"""
    Generate a personalized workout plan for a user with the following profile:
    - Age: {user_profile.get('age', 'N/A')}
    - Sex: {user_profile.get('sex', 'N/A')}
    - Weight: {user_profile.get('weight', 'N/A')} kg
    - Height: {user_profile.get('height', 'N/A')} cm
    - Experience Level: {user_profile.get('experience', 'Beginner')}
    - Goals: {goals} ({user_profile.get('phase', 'Maintenance')})
    - Category/Equipment: {category}
    - Recent Workout History Summary (if available): {history if history else 'None'}
    - Current Mood (1-10, 1=very bad, 10=very good): {current_mood if current_mood else 'N/A'}
    - Mood Context: {mood_context if mood_context else 'None'}

    Constraints:
    - The workout should be suitable for the specified experience level and category.
    - If mood is low (e.g., < 5), suggest a slightly less strenuous or shorter workout, perhaps focusing on mobility or lighter exercises. Acknowledge the user's feeling.
    - If the user is a beginner, ease them in with simpler exercises and focus on form.
    - Provide exercises with sets, reps (or duration for cardio/isometrics), and rest periods.
    - Include brief instructions on proper form for each exercise or suggest reliable sources.
    - Structure the output clearly, perhaps in JSON format or well-structured text.
    - Avoid promoting unrealistic fitness standards. Focus on consistency and health.

    {{
      "plan_name": "Beginner Home Workout - Day 1",
